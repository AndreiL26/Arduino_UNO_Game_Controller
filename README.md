# Arduino_UNO_Game_Controller -> demo available [here]('https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c2jMIr-F5NqIebdQM4C9fnch6Qukyf52/view?usp=sharing')

This repository contains the implementaion of an Arduino Uno board as a controller for a simple 2D game made with Unity. The documentation contains information on how to set-up the project in order to run it, whilst the Code folder contains all the code required to built the project, which is quite self-explanatory.
There is also a folder containing the build for PC.

More information and description of the project will soon be available at https://andreil26.github.io/me/.
